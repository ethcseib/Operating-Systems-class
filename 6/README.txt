File: README.txt

Included Files:
	 README.txt - A readme for the project to provide some information.
	 schedule_fcfs.c - The implementation of the First Come First Serve
	 		 scheduling algorithm.
	 schedule_sjf.c - The implementation of the Shortest Job First
	 		scheduling algorithm.
	 schedule_priority.c - The implementation of the Priority scheduling
	 		      algorithm.
	 schedule_rr.c - The implementation of the Round Robbin scheduling
	 	       algorithm.

How to use:
    1) Decide which algorithm to use and type make followed by the string
       that proceeds the underscore.
    2) Then execute the chosen algorthm using
       ./<algorithm> <list of tasks .txt>. For example ./fcfs schedule.txt
       
Features to implement:
	There is nothing left for me to implement because all required
	objectives were achieved.

What I have learned:
     I got a needed refresher on how linked lists work, and I got significant
     practice in understanding what is left to do in a program by finding the
     missing pieces in the code. There were also some C syntax that I learned.
